# Sleep Time Prediction Project

## Purpose
This project analyzes sleep time and the impact of metrics such as workout time, relaxation time, phone time, and work hours. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning to understand and predict sleep patterns.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, Decision Tree)

## Data Source
The dataset is a public Kaggle dataset focused on sleep and related behavioral metrics. Contains the following metrics: `SleepTime` (dependent variable), `WorkoutTime`, `ReadingTime`, `PhoneTime`, `WorkHours`, `CaffeineIntake`, `RelaxationTime`.

## Highlights
- Comprehensive EDA with visualizations and feature engineering.
- Machine learning models compared using well-known performance metrics.
- Identified Random Forest and Gradient Boosting as top-performing models.

## Applications
- Health insights and behavioral analytics.
- Potential deployment as a predictive model in production.

## Potential Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning and additional features.
- Model deployment.
